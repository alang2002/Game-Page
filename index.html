    <h1><b>My Favorite Gaming Systems</b></h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Microsoft's Xbox One</h2>
    <img src="images/xboxone.jpg" alt="Xbox One">
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>
      was made by Microsoft. It was released in 2013 and is one of the next gen
      consoles we know today. It's largest competitor is the PS4 from Sony.
      Since it's release, several editions of the popular console have been put
      on the market, like the Xbox One S.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Sony's Playstation 4</h2>
    <img src="images/ps4.jpg" alt="Playstation 4">
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4" target="_blank">Playstation 4</a>
    was made by Sony. It was released in 2013 as a competitor to the also successful
    Xbox One. It is the eight generation of home consoles. It has a large amount of
    exclusive titles compared to the Xbox One. It also features other editions,
    like the PS4 Pro.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Nintendo's Nintendo Switch</h2>
    <img src="images/switch.jpg" alt="Nintendo Switch">
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>
    is one of the first major consoles to feature a sort of
    "on the go" idea. It has a screen built into the console itself, along with
    motion controllers, called "Joycons", similar to how the Wii controller works.
    Many have claimed it to be quite innovative as no other major console on the market
    is capable of this.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Valve's HTC Vive</h2>
    <img src="images/vive.jpg" alt="HTC Vive">
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Vive" target="_blank">HTC Vive </a>
    is a VR (virtual reality) headset developed by both HTC and Valve. It uses a headset
    that is mounted to the user's upper face, acting like a giant pair of goggles.
    It immerses the user in a virtual world by using motion tracking, and handheld
    controllers shaped to fit naturally within the user's hand.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Gaming PC</h2>
    <img src="images/pc.jpg" alt="Gaming PC">
    <p>Aside from home consoles, there are gaming computers. These are home computers
    that are suited mainly for gaming rather than work or personal use. Most usually
    come with plenty of RAM, storage, a good graphics card and CPU. Each part is just
    as important as the other, and they almost always cost hundreds of dollars, usually
    over $1000 or above. High end PCs sometimes go over $2000. Overall though, they
    are more capable than home consoles, able to achieve higher frames per second,
    play more titles, and among other things.</p>
